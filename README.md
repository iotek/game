game
====

A game made by members of [nixers](http://nixers.net). The current plan is a
"top-down RPG with a cyberpunk setting". We are writing it in C and SDL. We
have a forum thread [here](http://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1621), and
regularly discuss development over at [#game](irc://irc.nixers.net/#game) on
irc.nixers.net.

Building
--------

To build the project, simply use

```Bash
make
```

And run the binary

```Bash
./game
```

The name of the binary is subject to change, and we'll add install/deinstall
targets in the future, so keep an eye out.

Contributing
------------

Generally we advise people make forks and pull requests, as it allows us to
discuss changes before it's too late and means we don't have issues where two
people have changed the same file and it becomes a pain to merge. Be sure to
hop on IRC for the most up-to-date discussions.

Style
-----

We plan on using [astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net) with a custom config
to format the code. This means you can write however you like and simply run
astyle to clean up after yourself. We will reject or at least ask you to run
astyle on any pull requests that are not formatted correctly.

TODO
